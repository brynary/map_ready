MapReady
========

A Rails plugin to convert models into map ready marker objects. Includes support for marker clustering and offsetting. Requires the geokit and geokit-rails.

The plugin provides several strategies for building map marker objects from mappable ActiveRecord models. Currently, a mappable ActiveRecord model is one that "acts_as_mappable" as defined in the geokit-rails plugin (dependency). The strategies include:
 1. one-to-one conversion (simple), 
 2. grouping by proximity (clustered), 
 3. offsetting by location (offset).

Dependencies
